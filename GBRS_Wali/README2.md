# Another readme file just for this folder.

So there are a lot of works concerning Wali's part of the work. So a seperate folder is created.

# About the D2V model

It requires a lot of time to train the model, and it has already been trained. Now if you don't want to train it again, you can directly load the model file. Again, the files are very large so I didn't upload them if you need them please contact me, I will send a google drive link to you.
